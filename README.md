# Solutions to *An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp* Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises in the book
[*An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp*](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/eintr.html).

You can read this book directly in Emacs:

* Type `M-x info`
* Search for "Emacs Lisp Intro" with `C-s Emacs Lisp Intro`. (With [spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs),
    type `SPC h i` and then `eintr`)
* Press `RET` to start reading the book

That way you will be able to copy and evaluate examples.
